# Intro to React – Computer Science & Software Engineering Club 

Welcome! This repo is for my **React presentation** at the Computer Science & Software Engineering Club.  
It contains multiple branches that show React concepts step by step — from the basics all the way to a mini project.  

---

## Repo Structure
Each branch corresponds to one step in the presentation:

- `main` → Clean React + Vite template (baseline project)  
- `step-1-hello-world` → First component with Tailwind CSS  
- `step-2-props` → Passing props into components  
- `step-3-state` → Counter component with React `useState`  
- `step-4-lists` → Rendering lists with `.map()`  
- `step-5-conditional` → Conditional rendering with toggle  
- `step-6-mini-project` → Small project combining everything
